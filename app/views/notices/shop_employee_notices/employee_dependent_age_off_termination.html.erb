If your dependent child does not qualify to enroll in employer-sponsored coverage or other coverage at this time, the annual individual market open enrollment period for #{notice.enrollment.plan_year} begins #{notice.enrollment.ivl_open_enrollment_start_on}.

Your dependent child can create a #{Settings.site.short_name} account and complete an eligibility application for individual marketplace coverage to review health plan options and learn whether they might be eligible for financial assistance. If your dependent lives outside the District of Columbia, they can apply during open enrollment through the health insurance exchange operating in their state.
